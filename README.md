Contributors: Ola Nikolai Skjeret, Simen Elvhaug

## What the project does


## Why the project is useful
This project aims to raise awarness towards poverty, even in countries where it may seem less as a problem.

## How users can get started with the project


## Where users can get help with your project
Go to the "issues" tab on the game's repository. Open a new issue if it doesn't already exist.

## Which technology is used
We have structured our CSS using SASS/SCSS with nesting and also using BEM naming to organize our HTML and CSS. We have used a JavaScript script to implement the intersection observer. The intersection observer makes us able to start animations at a certain point when scrolling through the webpage. It is used on all 5 "slides" of the story.
